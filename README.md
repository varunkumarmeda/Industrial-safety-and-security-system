# Industrial-safety-and-security-system
An arduino project to implement the safety and security systems in an industry/factory.
# Scope and objective of project
From the statistics annually more than 3000 accident cases are being registered in
the industries. As a team our objective is to implement the Safety and security system for
any kind of industry and bring down the cases. We take care of machines of the industry or
factory by using the sensors effectively.

# System design(discuss about functionality of modules)
Our arduino will be handling the functionality and communicating with the different
components
When operating some machines, it can vibrate more than normal. So, our vibration
sensor will sense the vibration and alert the control room to turn off the machines or
speed down to the machines.
Some rooms will store important things in a factory or industry. So maybe few employees
have the right to enter those rooms. So, there will be a motion sensor in these rooms.
So, any unauthorised persons will not be entered these rooms. If authorised persons
enter the room they will turn off the motion sensor before entering the room.
Temperature plays an important role in an industry or factory. So, every time we need to
monitor the temperature of machines or products. From the control room they can control
the temperature by turning on or off the fans.
Gas emission will also be monitored properly in an industry or factory. Some gases are toxic
and that will not be good for human health. So, when gas emits in an inaccurate level an
exhaust fan will turn on automatically and emit the gases from the industry.
Dust sensor will monitor the amount of dust and display it on the LCD to evacuate the
workers from the factory.
